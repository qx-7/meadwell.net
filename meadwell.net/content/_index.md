## Hi! My name is Mel.

I'm a student in the field of religious studies. I'm interested in art, culture, and the significance of myth in society. I really enjoy reflecting on the nature of the world around me, and I *really* really enjoy discussing it with others! [More about me.](/about)

Check out my [posts](/posts), where I publish all sorts of thoughtful reflections!

{{< note >}}This site is built from scratch with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a hearty portion of elbow grease. See the [site source files on GitHub](https://github.com/qx-7/meadwell.net). My theme is not currently publicly available, but I'd like to clean it up real nice for you all to use and modify someday.{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}I'll have RSS and Atom feeds set up Very Soonâ„¢! Hopefully mid-Feb 2025 will see the full implementation of feeds ðŸ’ª{{< /note >}}
