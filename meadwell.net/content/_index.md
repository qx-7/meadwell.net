## Hi! My name is Mel.

I'm a 20-something queer writer, artist, thinker. I'm interested in art, culture, and the significance of myth in society. I really enjoy reflecting on the nature of the world around me, and I *really* really enjoy discussing it with others! [More about me.](/about)

Do you have a burning question stuck in your mind? Are you curious to know how I built this site? Is your life just a little bit too boring and same-y lately? [Send me a message!](/contact/)

Check out my [posts](/posts), where I publish all sorts of neat stuff!

I plan to put more of a personal profile on this page pretty soon. Presently my personality is particularly pervasive throughout this project, but... proper people possess profiles!! Profiles professing _personality, pursuits, and passions_ are perhaps precious pronunciations of prospective personhood, and _I wanna be somebody!!!_
