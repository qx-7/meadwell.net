I've been having trouble putting myself to bed lately.
It always feels like a little bit of a waste to go to sleep for the night, as if there's any more day to even be had.
As if going to sleep now weren't actually even _better_ for doing stuff tomorrow morning after a good rest.

Today I've decided to write about it.
Best way out is through, I figure, and maybe this will help kick me into a more actively creative mood for the summer.
As things are, I'm really eager to do _something_ interesting and artsy-fartsy this summer, but I haven't been particularly able to motivate myself into actually _doing_ much of anything beyond my normal scope.

I think part of my issue is that I find it hard to set down my tools when I'm done.
Hell, even labelling something "done" can be tricky.

Maybe that's part of my issue with getting to bed on time, too.
It's hard for me to set down the day and disengage, despite knowing that I'll be re-engaging tomorrow morning after resting well.
Maybe I should make this sort of before-bed journalling a more regular activity if it works out.
There's a particular quality of end-of-day suchness to this writing session, capping off my tiring day with a brief personal reflection.

I really should get more seriously into poetry, both reading and writing.
I think I could be very silly in this respect.

Wrapping up, I'm happy to report that sketching out this quick journal blurbo _has indeed helped me disengage from my daytime attachments!!!_
Turns out that release really is as simple as unobstructed expression.
Sweetness!

My shoulder is starting to let me know that it's time to find a proper sleeping position now.
Guess that's my cue...

Sweet dreams out there!
