Happy May, dear readers! It feels like summer has finally returned to my pocket of the world!

I went for a celebratory beginning-of-summer stroll, smelling familiar scents, feeling my skin toast under the sun's direct attention.
It reminded me of my early childhood in a way that my frequent wintertime walks didn't;
my childhood happened in the summers.
Wintertime in the suburbs on the prairie is difficult, especially for those without the privilege to simply up and leave their homes in the bitter cold.
Only during summertime could I freely wander, independent from imposed responsibilities.
Summertime smells soft, scents swimming slowly; something suggests stillness.

Anyhoo...

## Open Source and Licensing

I recently made the decision to license this site under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3-or-later](/2025/05/misc-agpl-3.0-or-later),
and the content under [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](/2025/05/misc-cc-by-sa-4.0).
Both of these licenses allow anyone to do anything with the site's layout code and the content, as long as the derivative work or distributed version is licensed under the same terms.
_What the fuck is a license?_, I hear you grumbling; do not despair, O reader, for elucidation lies ahead.

### Licenses and Copyright

Before I begin explaining how copyleft licensing works, I'll provide some context on the legal and creative environment created by modern intellectual property (IP) copyright law.

By default, in much of the world, when a person creates a work, use of that work by others is restricted by copyright.
Aside from exceptions under _fair use_, default copyright is "all rights reserved."
This means that the copyright holder _reserves_ all creative rights to the IP,
including the rights to distribute the original work,
and to create and distribute derivative works.
It infringes upon copyright law, for example,
to publish a book of someone else's writing, unless explicit permission is given in the form of _licensing_.

"Licensing" a work involves the copyright holder laying out explicit terms of use for the IP.
Book authors license their works to publishers to distribute the IP.
Authors license their works to movie studios to create derivative works (film adaptations) and distribute them.
And of course, software authors license their programs to users and clients.

Most pieces of software people use are licensed under _some_ terms of use, distribution, and/or contribution.
Unless a piece of software is written and used entirely privately, it is likely licensed in some way.
