I'm not sure whether this film should be as good as it is. John Hughes famously wrote the entire original script in one weekend, though the film needed some [expert editing by Paul Hirsch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kt-wlM9Ucs) to really shine as much as it did on release.

_FBDO_ really feels like it's about Cameron, and to some extent, Jeanie. Ferris is shown from the very first scene to be oddly comfortable doing pretty much anything: skipping school, lying to his parents, and otherwise generally seizing the day. It seems like every character who _isn't_ Ferris spends the whole movie just trying to catch up with him. Jeanie and Mr. Rooney both spend large portions of their screentime pursuing Ferris and actively sabotaging his plans for the day; Sloane almost feels like a passionate disciple of Ferris'; Ferris' parents spend the majority of the film entirely disconnected from him in their worldly adult working lives; Cameron is the reluctant chosen one to whom Ferris forcibly teaches the importance of _just living_.

This movie rocks. It's so fun and joyful and youth-positive and celebratory and just all-around a fantastic watch.

8.5/10
