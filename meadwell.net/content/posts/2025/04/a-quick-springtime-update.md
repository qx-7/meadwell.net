Hi! Time for a springtime update, I think! April is nearly over, and I've been away since February.

This winter has been pretty tough for a number of reasons... seasonal depression was hitting _really_ hard, I had just lost a friend group, I was dealing with shitty family dynamics, and I was stressed about all kinds of stuff, and a million other things of various levels of impact to my psyche. All that kept me from doing a lot of fun things, and I've been neglecting passion projects. Fortunately, the semester has nearly ended, and the weather has improved, and the sunlight is back (on loan from the southern hemisphere), and I have learned and healed so so much. All this is to say that I'm poised to _really_ do some neat shit this summer. I feel a bit of a glowup coming on... but my glow is from within; material things do not illuminate.

I'm not sure what my glowup summer 2025 is going to look like, and that's pretty scary. It's difficult for me to deal with things that are uncertain---I suspect this to be related to my trouble with academia; I'll have the space and time to _do something_ this summer, which I am wait-becoming _excitedly_...!

In the meantime, ... Actually, who am I kidding? I'm already doing it. I wasn't writing posts all winter, and now I am. It's important to be mindful of, and joyful about, this sort of sign-of-healing. Unfortunately, I am _very_ sleepy at time of writing, and you know how I get when I get sleepy...

...

...zzz

...! Oh-- I'm up! I'm just putting my so-- damn! I was asleep! I _knew_ I'd fall asleep.

## Get on with it!---the updates in question

Literally gonna spend all night at the keyboard if I don't just cut myself off at some point ðŸ‘…

I've been doing some fun shit on [webfun.meadwell.net](https://webfun.meadwell.net/), I've been writing this post, I've been working on the site theme behind the scenes, and I've been resolving and healing shit like nobody's business! I have big plans for this summer, particularly for this site.

The first real thing I want to put together is a media recommendations list full of my personally curated selection of Optimally Selected Viewing and Otherwise Efficient Methods of Story Consumption, complete with full reviews for each rec! It's going to be a bit of a long-term project, but I plan to get a good start on it this summer!

Feeds miiiight be implemented at a basic level? I'll have to make a proper announcement after I've got them configured in the way I like; til then, consider any stray feeds you find on the site to be IMPERMANENT and FLEETING!! I'll probably take the opportunity of the announcement to really dig into feeds and readers, figure it all out in the context of my own personal use case. I've been meaning to set up a feed reader (or three...) with a bunch of neat blogs' and small artists' feeds! This will be a _very_ good opportunity, indeed.

I also have been _itching_ to make video games, so I've decided to teach myself JavaScript as a solid first step in that direction! It runs in the browser, and it would be very handy for web development in general. It's super super easy to publish JS software; the majority of websites today serve JS scripts that execute code on your machine when you visit and/or use the site. I would love to publish games and little software tools on my website! Stay tuned. Not with the existing feeds, though, lol. Bookmarks are underappreciated; bookmark my site and check back often!

Speaking of itches, I've really been wanting to make---for lack of a better term---woke art: art that is socially progressive, culturally aware, thoughtful, considerate, and _impactful_. I want to make _good_ art that fuckin _hits_, but also that _makes room to be experienced_. I don't just want to catch your eye; I want to reach out and _grab_ your attention with a bold design and an engaging message.

## Closing thoughts

That's about all I've got for tonight! I had a big rambling paragraph here about how tired I am and how my thoughts are like ketchup that aren't being stirred around anymore... yeah. I'm sleepy. I have no thoughts.

## Closing

Much better. :)

I'm off to bed now! Sleep tight, I hear you whispering. You as well!, I hear myself whispering back.

Good night! Love you all ðŸ’›
