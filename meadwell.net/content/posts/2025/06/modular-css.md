I've finally grown sick and TIRED of my terrible CSS on here.
That's right, I've actually gone and snapped.
I'm gonna fix this shit.
I'm a beast on the HUNT for stylesheet bugs!!

## The Current Sitch

Most of the CSS on this site was made in a very loosey-goosey fashion.
My approach while hacking together the beginnings of the site was to just aim for Good Enough,
but the time has finally come to give that up for good and fix everything.

The majority of the styling rules apply to very particularly marked up elements,
and I would not trust my stylesheets to do well on any site that isn't _exactly the same as mine is right now_.
This approach to writing CSS fucking sucks!

Enter: modular CSS.

## The (My) Future is Modular

Today I read through Scott Vandehey's article
"[What is Modular CSS?](https://spaceninja.com/blog/2018/what-is-modular-css/)",
and now I have found the motivation to get cracking on my own stuff!
Scott reviews the difficulties of traditional non-modular CSS in frontend web dev,
and then goes on to introduce a few existing frameworks.
I'll be referencing his writeup all throughout my stylesheet overhaul process.
Give it a read if you're interested!
