Happy first blog post!

It's a little late, so I'll keep this short, but... wow. I've got my site online! And I have a blog! Yay! That's so cool :)))

I've been working on this shit non-stop for the past couple weeks, and it's been so fun and fulfilling. I think I made my first shitty HTML page at age 12-ish? I've come so far, yet the thrill remains. :D There's something so special about designing a webpage and then publishing that page for the world to see. Hell, I find satisfaction just _organizing_ a website project like this, let alone actually _publishing_ anything.

## The dilemma of choice

How in the world am I going to decide what to do with my homepage? I could do _literally anything_ and that makes it really hard to pick!!

I definitely want to have some sort of digital display case for all of my cute web trinkets, but that's still a pretty undeveloped idea. I'll have to spend some time browsing around other people's sites for examples of this sorta thing.

## What about me?

The [about me page](/about) could also use an overhaul. Actually, speaking of, I was inspired to make a sort of bullet point autobiography to recap the recent events in my life and get people caught up. I started writing one, but oh my _god_ is it ever taxing to write such dense shit. That, and having all these significant events called to mind at once. It's kinda difficult LOL

Anyhoo, I'll have that bullet bio up sooner than later...!

Also, I saw that [The Doctor lists TV tropes](https://drwho.virtadpt.net/page/frequently-asked-questions/) in response to the FAQ "Got a character sheet?"---that's fucking sick! I will absolutely be compiling a list of my own tropes over the coming weeks. ;)

## Readings n whatnot

Regarding [the library](/library), I'm not sure what sort of pages I actually want to publish there! I'm sure _something_ will come to mind, but I might have to put some silly stuff there instead for the meantime...

## Wrapping up

You know it's bedtime when words just aren't.... working. ;P

I'm very glad to be posting my first real material on here!! (. ❛ ᴗ ❛.) More to follow Soon™!

Good night, lovely readers! <3
