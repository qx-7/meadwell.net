This is a list of my favourite (and less-than-favourite) works of film, TV, and anime! If it could reasonably be burnt to a DVD, it belongs here.

{{< note "Update 2025-04-24: The list is online! Featuring a few special guests..." >}}...I'm 21 and I somehow miss DVDs already. Happy 2025...!

I'm just now beginning to work on these reviews, so my offerings are a little scant for now, but stay tuned, dear reader, for television like you've never experienced lies just ahead... One day this page will just auto-update to include any new reviews I've posted according to their frontmatter tags or something. Til then it's all manually updated.{{< /note >}}

### _Ferris Bueller's Day Off_ (1986; dir. John Hughes)

This movie rocks. It's so fun and joyful and youth-positive and celebratory and just all-around a fantastic watch.

8.5/10 pancreases
