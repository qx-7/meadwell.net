This is a list of my favourite (and less-than-favourite) works of film, TV, and anime! If it could reasonably be burnt to a disc and viewed on the crappy travel DVD player your cousin lent you for that cute-as-hell camping trip into the woods with your _really good friends_ you just reconnected for the first time since high school... it belongs here. :)

### _Ferris Bueller's Day Off_ (1986; dir. John Hughes)

This movie rocks. It's so fun and joyful and youth-positive and celebratory and just all-around a fantastic watch.
