## I'm Mel!

Not your average twenty-something: _I_ come with a free toaster!

### I'm a student in the field of religious studies.

Systems of belief fascinate me, particularly those that may be understood as both religion and secularism. I especially enjoy thinking about traditionally secular ideas through a religious studies lens.

### I'm queer and proud.

My pronouns are she/her and I think people of all genders are cute. Trans rights are human rights.

### I live on stolen land.

As a resident of Turtle Island, I must acknowledge that colonialism is a continuing act of genocide against the Indigenous peoples who have been stewards of this land for generations. I strongly urge you to read into the Land Back movement for Indigenous land sovereignty around the world, and to get involved in land sovereignty activism in your communities.
