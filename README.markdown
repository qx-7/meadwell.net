## About

Hi there, traveller! These are the source files for [my personal site at meadwell.net](https://meadwell.net). Have a gander!

## Dependencies

- `hugo` ≥0.147.0 (see [Quick Start in the Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) for installation instructions)

## Usage

Clone the repo and go to town!

- run `hugo` in the inner `meadwell.net` directory to render the production site
- run `hugo serve -D` in the inner directory to render and serve the site from Hugo's local development webserver. `-D` renders draft content (i.e., frontmatter contains `draft: true`)

See [License](#license).
